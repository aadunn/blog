Whattup whattup crew.

Started Good Friday off with a hike with some homies out by Liscomb River. The trail was easy and not too long but had a really great payoff at the end of it. After arriving to the furthest point in the loop there is a suspension bridge overlooking a waterfall that was serene AF.

Homie Emmitt found someone's soaking wet phone lying on the ground just after the waterfall. Upon inspection the phone had three registered contacts:

- Lisa
- Rbc
- Scallops

Lisa did not answer. Scallops, the homie, answered right away and did not respond to his given name of "Scallops". He was no help at all unfortunately. We called the last person the owner of the phone had called and he was super helpful and maybe the owner will be reunited with their phone.

After I was fresh once more, main homies Chisholm and Morgan picked up the boy for dinner. We went to this place called BUTARAMEN. It slapped. I ate the Pork Tantanmen extra spicy and I felt powerful.

God mode ramen. Highly recommend.
