**Welcome**

This started as a first look into using Jekyll that evolved into me actually caring about documenting the happenings of my life. I mostly wanted to look into it after seeing Nuno's [15 Days in Japan blog](http://15daysinjapan.com), where my theme clearly draws inspiration from.

Anyway hey, what is up, my homies.

My name is Alex Dunn. I am in my last year of Computer Science at Dalhousie University. I have taken a growing, side interest in photography over the last few years, I listen to a wide range of music from Bj√∂rk to Punk to R&B, and I enjoy playing and critcizing video games.

I plan on using this blog to document the happenings of my life because my memory sucks and years later when I forget who my friends are it'd be nice to look at pictures and probably, maybe remember. I don't plan on updating daily but rather whenever I recall this thing exists.

So, here's to that I guess. Cheers. üçµ
