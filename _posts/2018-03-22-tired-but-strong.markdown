**Semester Closing Soon**

School semester ends soon and I am excited to make the most of it. I am usually not a summer guy but I am so happy that the semester is out next month that I plan on getting things done this summer. 

In general, this semester hasn't been awful. Definitely a lot easier than some of my previous semesters but still challenging. I am beginning to feel burned out with school in general so let it be known how excited I am to be finished. I don't think I will ever miss school.

**Burger Week**

This week in Halifax is what we call [_Burger Week_](http://burgerweek.co). Restaurants across the HRM create a special burg for the event that is not on their current menu and usually leaves after the week ends. A very fun week to go out to eat with friends and try the different burgers of the year.

Went to [2 Doors Down](https://www.go2doorsdown.com/) today for a lunch and got their Bengal Burger. Was sick. Highly recommend.

Going to [Gahan House](http://halifax.gahan.ca/) tonight with some homies for their BBQ Crunch Burger. Let's go.

**Facebook Deletion**

Decided to finally take initiave on my personal privacy and delete my Facebook account. I realized I shouldn't just brush off the fact that I signed up for a service that is selling my data without my explicit permission. **_(Note: My explicit permission is not granted by accepting the Terms of Service agreement that is not accessibly understood by the average user)_**

Facebook has been losing my interest in recent months anyway, the only things holding me to the service were communication with certain friends and a few groups I was a part of. After I realized I didn't care as much about the groups themselves and just the people in them and that if my friends wanted to talk to me they could still do so, I decided to ditch the service.
