**Peggy's Cove**

Recently made a homie who is here on a work visa from Japan named Saori. Her best friend Misuzu was visiting from her hometown before they both went to NYC. I offered to take them to Peggy's Cove for the latter half of the day to show her friend the _truest_ Halifax experience. We stayed there for awhile in the cold to watch the sunset dip below the ocean.

After we got too cold to function, we drove back into town and grabbed a few donairs because Misuzu wanted to get the full experience. Was a super fun time.

Really interesting seeing Peggy's Cove out of the eyes of a tourist. To people like me that have lived here for our entire lives see Peggy's Cove as nothing more than some rocks with a lighthouse you cannot enter. But to them it was something really exciting and beautiful and it made me see Nova Scotia in a similar light. Love this place, you the homie for real, NS.
