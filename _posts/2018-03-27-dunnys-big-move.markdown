For the last month or two I have been using 95% of my free time researching Japan in preparation for my post-graduation trip. However, this week I have been thinking a lot about my life, where I want to be in the next few years, blahblahblah, etc. I have decided that I need a change of pace, so I am putting all of my effort into acquiring a work visa and working abroad for a year in Japan as soon as I graduate.

I broke the news to my parents tonight to hear their opinions and they were very supportive of the decision. Way more supportive than I was expecting actually. I expected them to question the decision a lot more than they did, but instead they were completely supportive. Love those guys.

I will try my best to get an IT job for my stay there but I am not sure how feasible that will be, what with my lack of Japanese language proficiency. Some people have told me I would be better off trying to get a few internships instead of one full time position because I won't be a desirable candidate for many jobs since I plan to leave after a year.

This was a huge decision for me, especially because I am such an introverted person, but I think that living abroad in Japan will teach me important things I can't learn by staying here and starting my career as soon as I graduate.

If anyone reading this has any helpful information on moving to Japan, acquiring a work visa, or anything related to this they think I should know, please drop me an email.
